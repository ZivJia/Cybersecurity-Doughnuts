# vue-workspace

Haven't found a good vue workspace. So creating this one and benefit the community.

### Features:
- Great zIndex management, no need to worry able the zIndex anymore. When you interact with these windows, zIndex will be automatically updated.
- Split Window however you want to!
- Ping the window to the background so you wont accidentally move it
- Too many windows? No problem! You can hide any windows and bring them up from the drawer at any time
- Split window, drop existing window into some empty split window won't re-render the existing one! It's simply position & size change.

### How to use it?
Just download this project and run it follow this README. And then you can play with it.
Change anything as you want, the core part is the logic in each component and the managers. Read them if you are interested.
